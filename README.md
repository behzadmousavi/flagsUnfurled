# flagsUnfurled
It is simple, I was trying to learn developing and using of flags in cobra library of golang, then I noticed I don't even know what are cobra basics let alone its other aspects. So I started implementing a very simple CLI application using golang and on the base of https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-create-a-cli-in-golang-with-cobra-d729641c7177.
But what is the story of its name? It is derived from the lyrics of the "High Hopes" by "Pink Floyd" and as my initial goal was learning of using flags in cobra, it just makes sense.
